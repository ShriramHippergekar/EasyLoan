EasyLoan is a full-stack Loan Management System I built using Spring Boot, React.js, and H2/MySQL.
It allows users to apply for loans and admins to approve, reject, or track them — with real-time updates and filtering.

I chose Spring Boot for its rapid backend development and REST API support, React for a responsive UI, and H2/MySQL for quick testing and production readiness. Swagger makes API testing seamless.

From sign-up to loan approval, every step is validated, stored, and reflected instantly — showing my ability to integrate backend logic, frontend UI, and database operations.

It’s a compact but realistic enterprise-style app, proving I can handle both ends of development and deliver functional, scalable solutions.
